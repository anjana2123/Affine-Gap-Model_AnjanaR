#### Alignment Matrix. The alignment matrix with a possible path encoding a specific alignment is depicted. Diagonal steps correspond to aligned amino acids while horizontal and vertical steps introduce gaps in chain 1 and 2, respectively. The path following arrows from 'End' to 'Start' refers to trace-back pointers set by Dijkstra's algorithm to mark the cheapest path found. Below the figure the alignment related to the marked path is displayed in gapped sequence description.
